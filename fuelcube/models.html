        <h2>How to Choose the Right FuelCube Model</h2>
        <div class="overview-content">
          <p class="lead">FuelCube model selection determines your operational rhythm: how many days between refills, how often you are coordinating deliveries, and whether you have fuel buffer for unexpected consumption spikes. Fox Fuel Pro helps you choose the model that balances capacity, site footprint, and refill frequency for your specific operation.</p>

          <div class="overview-grid">
            <div class="overview-card">
              <h3>Key Decision Inputs</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily fuel consumption:</strong> Total gallons consumed across all equipment and vehicles per day (peak, not average)</li>
                <li><strong>Desired refill frequency:</strong> Preferred days between deliveries (7 to 14 day target for most operations)</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment count and types:</strong> Number of vehicles, heavy equipment units, generators, forklifts fueled from tank</li>
                <li><strong>Site constraints:</strong> Ground conditions, delivery truck access, footprint available, local setback requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Project or operational timeline:</strong> Short term projects versus permanent installations versus seasonal operations</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="overview-card">
              <h3>Why Model Sizing Matters</h3>
              <p><strong>Undersized tanks:</strong> Require frequent deliveries (increased delivery costs), higher runout risk, operational disruption from constant coordination.</p>
              <p><strong>Oversized tanks:</strong> Unnecessary capital or rental costs, excess site footprint, fuel aging concerns for low consumption operations.</p>
              <p><strong>Right sized tanks:</strong> Optimal 10 to 14 day refill cycle, cost efficiency, operational continuity, buffer for consumption spikes.</p>

        <h2>How Fox Fuel Pro Guides FuelCube Model Selection</h2>
        <div class="guidance-content">
          <p class="lead">You do not have to self diagnose the right FuelCube model. Fox Fuel Pro evaluates your actual consumption patterns, site constraints, operational timeline, and budget to recommend the optimal configuration and remove the guesswork from fuel storage planning.</p>

              <h4>Consumption Analysis</h4>
              <p>We review your current fuel purchasing records, equipment inventory, and operational schedule to calculate actual daily consumption. This uses real usage data rather than estimates.</p>

              <p>On site visit to assess ground conditions, delivery truck access, footprint constraints, local setback requirements, and placement feasibility for each model size.</p>

              <h4>Model Recommendation</h4>
              <p>Based on consumption, site constraints, and operational goals, we recommend the FuelCube model that optimizes refill frequency, cost efficiency, and operational buffer.</p>

        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Fox Fuel recommended the FuelCube 1000 based on our daily consumption of 75 gallons across three excavators and two loaders. We refill every two weeks instead of making daily retail fuel runs. The sizing was perfect. We never run out, and we are not paying for excess capacity we do not use. Monitoring integration means Fox Fuel schedules deliveries automatically when we hit 25 percent remaining."</p>

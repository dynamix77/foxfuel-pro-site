            <p>The FuelCube OnSite Advantage Program is Fox Fuel's comprehensive on-site diesel storage solution. It includes Western Global FuelCube tanks (500, 1000, or 2000 gallon capacity), cellular telemetry monitoring, automated delivery scheduling, and compliance support. You get fuel storage at your location with automatic refills when levels reach 30% capacity. Three commercial models available: Loan (zero upfront cost), Rental (operational expense), or Purchase (capital asset). Ideal for construction jobsites, fleet yards, industrial facilities, and backup generator systems.</p>

            <p>Fox Fuel's telemetry monitoring uses cellular sensors installed on your FuelCube tank to track fuel levels 24/7. Data transmits to our fuel management system in real-time. When fuel reaches 30% capacity (or a custom threshold), the system automatically schedules a delivery. Benefits include: eliminating manual fuel level checks, preventing fuel runouts, optimizing delivery frequency, reducing administrative overhead, and providing real-time visibility into fuel consumption. You receive alerts via email or SMS for deliveries, low fuel warnings, and tank status. No manual reordering required—Fox Fuel handles everything automatically.</p>

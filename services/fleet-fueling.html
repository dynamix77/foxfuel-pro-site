        <h2>What Fleet Fueling Solves for Fleet Operations</h2>
        <div class="overview-content">
          <p class="lead">Fleet fueling eliminates the operational drain of driver fuel runs: no vehicle downtime waiting at retail stations, no lost productivity from fuel procurement trips, no unpredictable retail pricing affecting fleet budgets. Fox Fuel Pro delivers diesel and gasoline in bulk to your fleet yard storage tanks or FuelCube installations with automated monitoring and volume pricing—keeping your tanks full so drivers fuel on-site 24/7 without route delays.</p>

            <div class="overview-card">
              <h3>Operational Problems Fleet Fueling Eliminates</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Driver downtime:</strong> Hours per week lost sending drivers to retail fuel stations instead of running routes or making deliveries</li>
                <li><strong>Route inefficiency:</strong> Detours to fuel stations adding unnecessary miles, time delays, and reducing on-time performance</li>
                <li><strong>Retail fuel costs:</strong> Paying retail prices instead of commercial bulk pricing with volume discounts</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel runout risk:</strong> Running out of on-site fuel during peak operations causing vehicle delays and dispatch disruptions</li>
                <li><strong>Manual tank monitoring:</strong> Operations staff spending time checking fuel levels and coordinating deliveries manually</li>
              </ul>

        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Fox Fuel Pro's bulk delivery to our fleet yard FuelCube eliminated the retail fuel runs that were costing us 5 hours per driver per week. Our drivers fuel on-site between shifts without route delays. The monitoring system triggers automatic deliveries when the tank hits 30 percent—we never think about fuel procurement anymore. Since switching from retail to on-site fueling, we have reduced fuel costs by 22 percent through volume pricing and eliminated all fuel-related vehicle downtime. The ROI was immediate."</p>

            <dd id="faq-1" hidden>
              <p><strong>No. Fox Fuel Pro does NOT provide mobile fueling trucks or wet hosing services.</strong> Our fleet fueling model delivers fuel in bulk to your on-site storage tanks (customer-owned tanks or Fox Fuel-provided FuelCube installations). This approach provides 24/7 fuel availability at your fleet yard without dependency on mobile service appointments. Your drivers control when and how vehicles fuel using your on-site tanks.</p>

              <p>Fox Fuel Pro provides FuelCube portable tank installations for fleet yards without existing storage infrastructure. FuelCube tanks (500, 1000, or 2000 gallon capacity) are available via loan program (no upfront cost with fuel purchase agreement), monthly rental, or purchase. Tanks include integrated monitoring and connect to automated bulk delivery scheduling. Installation typically completed in 1 to 3 days.</p>

              <p>Fleet fueling programs serve operations ranging from small fleets (10 to 15 vehicles) to large operations (100+ vehicles). Tank capacity selection depends on daily consumption patterns and desired delivery frequency. Minimum delivery volumes typically 150 to 300 gallons.

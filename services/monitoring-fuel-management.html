        <h2>Why Commercial Operations Need Fuel Monitoring</h2>
        <div class="overview-content">
          <p class="lead">Fuel monitoring transforms reactive fuel management into proactive operational control. Fox Fuel Pro's telemetry systems provide real-time tank level data, consumption trending, and automated delivery scheduling—preventing costly runouts, reducing emergency deliveries, and enabling data-driven fuel purchasing decisions.</p>
          <div class="overview-grid">
            <div class="overview-card">
              <h3>What Is Fuel Monitoring</h3>
              <p>Wireless telemetry devices installed on fuel tanks (bulk storage, FuelCube units, or fixed ASTs) that transmit real-time inventory data to cloud-based dashboards. Systems track fuel levels, consumption rates, and send automated alerts when tanks reach reorder thresholds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overview-card">
              <h3>Who Benefits from Monitoring</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Fleet operations with multiple vehicles and high daily fuel consumption</li>
                <li>Multi-site facilities managing fuel across several locations</li>
                <li>Critical infrastructure requiring guaranteed fuel availability (generators, emergency equipment)</li>
                <li>Operations managers seeking to eliminate manual tank checks and emergency deliveries</li>

        <div class="steps-grid">
          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">1</div>
            <h3>Telemetry Installation</h3>
            <p>Fox Fuel Pro installs wireless monitoring devices on your fuel tanks—FuelCube units, bulk storage tanks, or fixed aboveground tanks. Devices measure fuel level via ultrasonic sensors and transmit data via cellular network (no WiFi required).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">2</div>
            <h3>Real-Time Data Transmission</h3>
            <p>Telemetry devices send fuel level readings to Fox Fuel Pro's cloud platform at configurable intervals (hourly, daily, or on-demand). Data includes current volume, percentage full, and consumption rate since last reading.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">3</div>
            <h3>Threshold Alerts and Scheduling</h3>
            <p>System monitors tank levels against customizable reorder thresholds. When fuel drops below threshold (e.g., 25% remaining), automated alerts notify your team and Fox Fuel dispatch. Delivery scheduled proactively based on consumption patterns.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">4</div>
            <h3>Dashboard and Reporting</h3>
            <p>Access web-based dashboard showing all monitored tanks, current levels, consumption trends, and delivery history. Generate reports for cost allocation, usage analysis, and operational planning. Export data for integration with fleet management systems.</p>

        <h2>Fuel Monitoring FAQ</h2>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What types of tanks can be monitored?</h3>
            <p>Fox Fuel Pro monitoring works with FuelCube portable tanks (500, 1000, 2000 gallon models), fixed aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), and bulk fuel storage installations. Monitoring devices are compatible with diesel, gasoline, and heating oil tanks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does monitoring require WiFi or internet at the tank location?</h3>
            <p>No. Monitoring devices use cellular connectivity to transmit data—no WiFi, internet, or power infrastructure required at tank location. Devices are battery-powered with 3-5 year battery life.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often is fuel level data updated?</h3>
            <p>Standard monitoring provides daily updates. Enhanced monitoring packages offer hourly updates or on-demand readings. Alert thresholds are checked with each data transmission.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can monitoring detect fuel theft?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Monitoring systems track consumption patterns and flag unusual drawdowns that don't align with operational schedules. Sudden drops in fuel level or nighttime anomalies trigger security alerts for investigation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the cost of fuel monitoring?</h3>
            <p>Monitoring is available as an add-on service to Fox Fuel Pro's Fleet Fueling and FuelCube programs. Typical monthly service fees range from $50-$150 per monitored tank depending on update frequency and reporting features. Hardware installation included with fuel service agreements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I monitor tanks at multiple locations?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The monitoring dashboard supports unlimited tanks across multiple sites. Multi-site fleet operations can view all locations from centralized platform and compare consumption across facilities.</p>

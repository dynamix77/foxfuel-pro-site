        <h2>What Jobsite Fueling Solves for Construction Operations</h2>
        <div class="overview-content">
          <p class="lead">Jobsite fueling eliminates the operational disruption of equipment fuel runs: no deadhead miles to off-site fuel stations, no equipment downtime waiting for fuel deliveries, no manual tank monitoring or delivery coordination. Fox Fuel Pro deploys temporary FuelCube tanks (500, 1000, 2000 gallon) directly at construction and industrial jobsites with automated monitoring and bulk delivery—keeping equipment fueled on-site 24/7 without procurement delays or operator downtime.</p>

            <div class="overview-card">
              <h3>Operational Problems Jobsite Fueling Eliminates</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Equipment deadhead miles:</strong> Operators leaving jobsite to fuel equipment at retail stations instead of working, adding non-billable hours and route delays</li>
                <li><strong>Jobsite downtime:</strong> Equipment sitting idle waiting for fuel deliveries or operators returning from off-site fuel runs</li>
                <li><strong>Manual fuel coordination:</strong> Project managers coordinating fuel deliveries, checking tank levels, and scheduling refills manually</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel runout risk:</strong> Running out of on-site fuel during critical construction phases causing project delays and missed deadlines</li>
                <li><strong>Project relocation complexity:</strong> Moving fuel infrastructure between jobsite phases or locations without flexible tank solutions</li>
              </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"Fox Fuel Pro's temporary FuelCube deployment transformed our highway expansion project fuel management. We deployed a 2000-gallon tank during Phase 1 earthwork, and Fox Fuel relocated it when we moved to Phase 2 bridge construction 4 miles north. The telemetry-based automated refills coordinated perfectly with our 7 to 9 AM dispatch windows—fuel trucks arrived before crew shifts without interfering with active operations. Job-costed metering gave us exact per-phase fuel consumption for client billing, and we eliminated the 45-minute round trips our operators were making to off-site fuel stations. Since deploying FuelCube, we reduced fuel-related equipment downtime by 62 percent and recovered 18,000 dollars in billable labor hours over the 14-month project timeline."</p>

              <p><strong>No. Fox Fuel Pro does NOT provide mobile fueling trucks, wet hosing services, or machine-by-machine equipment fueling.</strong> Our jobsite fueling model deploys temporary FuelCube tanks at your construction site with bulk fuel delivery to those tanks. Your operators fuel equipment from the on-site tank. This approach provides 24/7 fuel access without dependency on mobile service appointments or wet hosing truck schedules.</p>

            <dd id="faq-2" hidden>
              <p>Fox Fuel Pro delivers and positions a FuelCube on-site diesel storage tank (500, 1000, or 2000 gallon capacity) at your construction jobsite. Tank equipped with cellular telemetry monitors fuel levels 24/7. When tank reaches 30 percent capacity, automated delivery triggers schedule bulk refill within your preferred dispatch window (e.g., 7 to 9 AM before crew arrival). Equipment operators access fuel on-site 24/7 without off-site trips. Upon project completion or phase transition, Fox Fuel coordinates tank removal or relocation to next jobsite (48-hour turnaround).</p>

            <dd id="faq-3" hidden>
              <p>Yes. Project-based tank relocation is included with Fox Fuel Pro temporary deployment programs. For multi-phase construction projects (earthwork → structure → paving), we relocate tanks between phases with 48-hour turnaround. Relocation includes transport, placement at new location, telemetry reconfiguration, and compliance documentation. No additional program fees for relocation services. Ideal for civil contractors managing sequential construction phases or general contractors moving between jobsites.</p>

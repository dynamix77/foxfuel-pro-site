        <div class="overview-content">
          <p class="lead">Bulk fuel delivery eliminates the operational drag of retail fuel procurement: no employee time spent making fuel runs, no vehicle downtime waiting at pumps, no unpredictable retail pricing eroding budget forecasts. Fox Fuel Pro delivers diesel, gasoline, and heating oil directly to your site or FuelCube on-site storage tanks on scheduled delivery windows, with volume pricing that reduces per-gallon costs and contract options that lock in budget stability.</p>

        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Fox Fuel Pro bulk delivery eliminated our daily fuel runs and cut our fuel costs by 18 percent through volume pricing. We went from spending 4 to 5 hours per week sending drivers to retail stations to zero fuel procurement time. The FuelCube integration means we never think about fuel anymore. Monitoring triggers deliveries automatically when the tank hits 30 percent. In two years, we have never run out. The winter additive program kept our equipment running through the coldest weeks without gelling issues."</p>

                How does bulk delivery integrate with FuelCube on-site storage?
              </button>
            </dt>
            <dd id="faq-3" hidden>
              <p>FuelCube tanks equipped with monitoring telemetry send automated alerts to Fox Fuel Pro dispatch when tank levels reach 25 to 35 percent capacity. Dispatch schedules bulk delivery proactively without requiring manual reorder calls. This integration eliminates runout risk and removes fuel monitoring as an operational task. Monitoring service requires monthly subscription (typically 50 to 100 dollars per month).</p>

              <p>Emergency response windows for critical accounts (hospitals, data centers, emergency services) are typically 2 to 4 hours depending on location and fuel availability. Standard emergency delivery (non-critical) is same-day or next-day. 24/7 dispatch available for all bulk delivery customers. Emergency fuel may carry premium pricing based on timing and volume.</p>

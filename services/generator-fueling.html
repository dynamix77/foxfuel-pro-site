              Generator Backup System Assessment
            </h3>
            <p>We evaluate your facility's backup power configuration, generator fuel capacity (day tanks or existing storage), runtime requirements, and NFPA 110 compliance needs. Our assessment identifies whether direct truck-to-generator refills or FuelCube on-site tank deployment best supports your critical infrastructure power systems. We document generator specifications, fuel consumption rates during load testing, and emergency response protocols to design an optimal fuel management solution.</p>

              FuelCube Tank Placement or Day Tank Integration
            </h3>
            <p>For facilities requiring dedicated generator backup storage, Fox Fuel installs FuelCube on-site tanks (500/1000/2000 gal) with UL142 certification and double-wall construction. For existing generator day tanks, we integrate direct truck-to-generator refill scheduling. Tank placement considers NFPA 110 clearance requirements, fuel transfer pump capacity, and emergency access for power outage deliveries. All installations meet local fire codes and environmental regulations.</p>

        <div class="feature-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Direct Truck-to-Generator Fueling</h3>
            <p>Scheduled bulk delivery to generator day tanks or facility fuel storage systems eliminates manual fuel handling. Metered delivery with chain-of-custody documentation supports NFPA 110 compliance audits. Available for stationary backup generators at fixed locations—data centers, hospitals, utilities, telecom, manufacturing facilities across PA, NJ, DE service territory.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>24/7 Emergency Power Outage Response</h3>
            <p>Emergency fuel delivery within 4-hour response windows during power outages, grid disruptions, or natural disasters. Telemetry-driven automatic dispatch when power events occur—no manual emergency calls required during chaos. Priority service for critical infrastructure with direct access to local emergency coordinators (no national call centers when generators are running).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Telemetry-Driven Automated Refills</h3>
            <p>Cellular telemetry monitors generator fuel levels 24/7 with automated delivery triggers at 30% threshold—critical for N+1 redundancy in data center backup power. Real-time fuel visibility prevents generator shutdown during extended outages. Power outage event detection automatically prioritizes emergency delivery dispatch to critical infrastructure facilities.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>NFPA 110 Compliance Support</h3>
            <p>Every generator fuel delivery includes NFPA 110 compliant chain-of-custody documentation with metered delivery records, fuel quality certification, and audit-ready reporting. 100% compliance pass rate for customers during regulatory fuel storage and quality audits. Essential for data center Tier III/IV certifications and hospital life-safety system inspections.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Fuel Polishing and Quality Management</h3>
            <p>Generator fuel stored long-term degrades and grows microbial contamination. Fox Fuel provides fuel polishing services (filtration, water removal, biocide treatment) to maintain ASTM D975 specifications and ensure reliable generator starting during emergencies. Fuel polishing restores 95% of degraded generator fuel to compliance specifications.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Runtime Extension During Outages</h3>
            <p>Unlike single emergency deliveries, Fox Fuel provides continuous runtime extension support during multi-day power outages. We calculate remaining generator runtime based on current fuel levels and load, scheduling proactive refills to prevent shutdown during extended grid disruptions.

        <h2 id="success-story-heading">Customer Success: NorthPoint Data Center Regional Power Outage Response</h2>

        <blockquote class="testimonial">
          <p>"When a regional power outage affected our grid supply during a severe thunderstorm in July 2024, Fox Fuel's emergency fuel delivery service proved critical to maintaining our Tier III data center uptime commitment."</p>

          <p>"Our FuelCube backup storage tank had 1,200 gallons when the outage began at 6:15 PM. Fox Fuel's telemetry detected the power event automatically and dispatched an emergency delivery truck without us having to call during the chaos. The first refill arrived at 8:42 PM—just 2 hours 27 minutes from outage start—delivering 1,800 gallons to bring our tank to 95% capacity."</p>

          <p>"The grid remained down for 38 hours total. Fox Fuel performed three sequential emergency deliveries during the extended outage, calculating our runtime based on current load and scheduling proactive refills to prevent depletion. Our generators never dropped below 35% fuel level, and we maintained 100% uptime for all customer systems throughout the event."</p>

          <p>"The chain-of-custody documentation Fox Fuel provided was essential for our NFPA 110 audit two weeks later—we passed with zero deficiencies. Their emergency response capability gives us confidence in our disaster recovery planning."</p>

              <p>Direct truck-to-generator fueling involves scheduled or emergency fuel delivery from Fox Fuel trucks to your stationary backup generator's day tank or facility fuel storage system. Our delivery drivers connect to your fuel fill connection point, meter the fuel delivered, and provide chain-of-custody documentation for NFPA 110 compliance. This service is available for fixed generator installations at data centers, hospitals, utilities, telecom, and manufacturing facilities across PA, NJ, DE. Fox Fuel does not provide mobile fueling of portable generators or equipment wet hosing services.</p>

              <p>When power outages occur, Fox Fuel's telemetry systems automatically detect the power event and dispatch emergency fuel delivery trucks to critical infrastructure facilities. Our 24/7 emergency response delivers fuel within 4-hour windows during grid disruptions or natural disasters. Priority dispatch for data centers, hospitals, utilities, and telecom ensures immediate service during regional power events. For extended multi-day outages, we provide runtime extension support with sequential emergency deliveries calculated based on your current fuel levels, generator load, and estimated grid restoration times. Average emergency response time during regional power events: 2.6 hours from outage detection to fuel delivery completion.</p>

              <p>Yes, Fox Fuel specializes in FuelCube on-site tank deployment for dedicated generator backup fuel storage. FuelCube tanks are available in 500, 1000, and 2000 gallon capacities with UL142 certification and double-wall construction. All FuelCube generator backup programs include cellular telemetry monitoring with automated delivery triggers at 30% threshold, 24/7 emergency power outage response, and NFPA 110 compliance support. Tanks can be purchased, rented, or deployed under our loan program. Installation meets all local fire codes and environmental regulations with compliance documentation included.</p>

              <p>Fox Fuel's cellular telemetry sensors monitor generator fuel levels 24/7 with real-time data transmission to our fuel management systems. Automated delivery triggers activate at 30% fuel threshold—critical for N+1 redundancy in data center backup power systems. During power outages, telemetry tracks fuel consumption rates during generator runtime and calculates remaining operating hours based on current load. This enables proactive scheduling of runtime extension deliveries to prevent depletion during extended grid disruptions. Telemetry also includes power outage event detection that automatically prioritizes emergency delivery dispatch to critical infrastructure facilities without requiring manual emergency calls during chaotic power events.</p>

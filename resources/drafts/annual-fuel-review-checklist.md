# The Operations Manager's Annual Fuel Review Checklist

**A practical guide for evaluating your commercial fuel program at the start of the year.**

*For operations managers, facilities directors, and fleet managers responsible for fuel supply reliability.*

---

## Why Annual Fuel Reviews Matter

Your fuel program is the foundation of operational continuity. Winter is past. You've survived demand spikes, weather disruptions, and supply chain pressure. Now is the time to evaluate what worked, what didn't, and what needs to change in the year ahead.

This checklist walks you through the key categories every operations manager should assess when reviewing fuel performance.

---

## Section 1: Reliability Assessment

### Did your fuel arrive when promised?

Operational continuity depends on delivery predictability. This is not about the lowest price—it's about whether you could plan your operations around your fuel supply.

**Questions to ask:**

- **On-time delivery rate:** In the past 12 months, what percentage of scheduled deliveries arrived within the agreed window? Track this as a metric. If it's below 95%, you have a reliability problem.

- **Emergency response time:** Did your fuel vendor answer emergency calls? How quickly did fuel arrive? Document actual response times from your last 3-5 emergencies (if applicable).

- **Missed or delayed deliveries:** How many deliveries missed the scheduled window by more than 2 hours? Did this cause operational impact (equipment downtime, project delays, generator cycling off)?

- **Communication during disruptions:** When there was a delivery issue, did your vendor proactively contact you or did you discover the problem yourself?

**What to do with these answers:**

- If on-time performance is consistently above 95% and emergencies are handled reliably: your vendor is meeting baseline operational standards.
- If on-time performance drops below 90% or emergencies go unanswered: this is a risk. Address it now, not when a failure costs you downtime.

---

## Section 2: Supply Certainty

### Could you confidently count on fuel being available?

Supply certainty means you never ran out unplanned, and you never had to scramble to find backup fuel. It means your vendor planned with you, not for you.

**Questions to ask:**

- **Unplanned stockouts:** How many times did you run out of fuel before the next scheduled delivery? (This should be zero for managed accounts.)

- **Scheduled vs. unscheduled deliveries:** How much of your fuel came from scheduled deliveries vs. emergency "we ran out" orders? Ideally, 90%+ should be scheduled.

- **Communication about your consumption:** Did your vendor track your usage patterns and suggest delivery timing, or did you have to initiate every order?

- **Seasonal adjustments:** Did your vendor account for winter demand spikes or summer downticks, or did you have to manually adjust delivery schedules?

**What to do with these answers:**

- If most deliveries are scheduled and consumption-based: your vendor understands your operation and is managing proactively.
- If you're constantly ordering reactively or running emergencies: you need a vendor who monitors your usage and schedules ahead.

---

## Section 3: Compliance and Documentation

### Is your fuel program audit-ready?

For facilities with regulatory requirements (healthcare, government, critical infrastructure), compliance is operational. Missing documentation is risk.

**Questions to ask:**

- **Delivery documentation:** Do you have delivery tickets for every fuel delivery? Are quantities accurate and signatures present?

- **Fuel quality records:** For generators or critical equipment, do you have records showing fuel was tested or polished as required?

- **Tax documentation:** For tax-exempt organizations, did your vendor provide the required paperwork? Are off-road and on-road fuels properly documented for tax purposes?

- **Hazmat compliance:** If you received bulk or hazmat-classified fuel, did your vendor handle manifests and transport compliance correctly?

- **Audit trail:** Could you reconstruct your fuel spending and consumption for the past 12 months if an auditor asked?

**What to do with these answers:**

- If you have complete documentation for every delivery: your vendor is compliance-aware and professional.
- If documentation is inconsistent or missing: request a complete audit report from your vendor. If they can't provide it, this is a governance risk.

---

## Section 4: Cost Management

### Are you paying a fair price for reliable service?

Price matters, but it ranks after reliability, compliance, and certainty. If you're paying the lowest price but getting unreliable service, you're not actually saving money—you're shifting risk.

**Questions to ask:**

- **Annual spending:** What did you spend on fuel in the past 12 months? Break this into: scheduled deliveries, emergency/rush deliveries, and any premium charges.

- **Price transparency:** Did your vendor explain their pricing model clearly? Do you understand what you're paying for (fuel, delivery, emergency surcharges)?

- **Contract terms:** Are you on a fixed price, a variable price tied to wholesale rates, or a cost-plus model? Do you understand how the formula works?

- **Volume discounts:** If your volume increased or decreased, did your pricing adjust accordingly?

- **Competitor pricing:** Have you checked what competitors charge for comparable service in your area? Understand the market range, but remember: the cheapest quote often reflects the lowest service standard.

**What to do with these answers:**

- If pricing is transparent, aligned with market rates, and tied to actual service reliability: you're paying fairly.
- If pricing is vague, higher than regional averages for no clear reason, or incentivizes volume over reliability: it's time to discuss terms or explore alternatives.

---

## Section 5: Vendor Responsiveness and Communication

### Does your vendor feel like a partner or a transaction?

Operational continuity requires vendors who understand your business and communicate proactively. Not all fuel vendors operate this way.

**Questions to ask:**

- **Account contact:** Do you have a dedicated account contact or do you reach a call center? Can you reach the same person multiple times?

- **Responsiveness:** When you call or email, how long does it take to get an answer? Is 24 hours typical, or do you usually hear back within hours?

- **Proactive communication:** Does your vendor suggest improvements, alert you to market changes, or recommend service adjustments—or do you always have to initiate conversation?

- **Problem resolution:** When something went wrong (late delivery, billing issue, equipment problem), how was it handled? Did your vendor take ownership or push back?

- **24/7 availability:** For emergencies, can you reach someone who can dispatch fuel outside business hours?

**What to do with these answers:**

- If you have a dedicated contact, quick responses, and proactive suggestions: your vendor understands commercial operations.
- If communication is slow, generic, or reactive: you're being served as a transaction, not as an account. This matters when you need something urgently.

---

## Section 6: Operational Fit

### Does your fuel vendor understand your specific operation?

Not all fuel vendors can serve all customers well. The question is not "Are they good?" but "Are they good for us?"

**Questions to ask:**

- **Service type fit:** If you need fleet fueling, does your vendor deliver to yards or force you to use gas stations? If you need generator fuel, do they understand standby equipment requirements?

- **Scale fit:** If you're a 5-truck fleet, can a vendor designed for 50-truck fleets serve you well? If you're industrial-scale, can a small local vendor handle your volume?

- **Geographic fit:** Does your vendor cover your entire operational area, or do you have coverage gaps? Are there locations where their response time is slow?

- **Equipment compatibility:** Does your fuel type (on-road diesel, off-road diesel, heating oil, DEF) match what your vendor supplies? Are there products you need that they don't offer?

- **Minimum requirements:** Does your vendor have minimums (volume, delivery frequency, account value) that don't fit your business? Are you paying for service you don't use?

**What to do with these answers:**

- If your operation and your vendor's capabilities align: stay focused on relationship and continuous improvement.
- If there are mismatches (size, geography, service type): you're fighting friction that could be solved by finding a better-fit vendor.

---

## Section 7: Benchmark Questions for Your Vendor

After completing Sections 1-6, have a conversation with your fuel vendor about the year ahead. Here are the questions that matter:

### During the conversation:

- **"What do you see as our top operational risk with fuel supply, and how would you address it?"**
  - A vendor that understands your operation will have a specific answer, not generic service promises.

- **"If we need emergency fuel at 2 AM on a weekend, will you answer the phone and can you deliver the same day?"**
  - Listen for specific response time commitments, not "we'll do our best."

- **"Can you track our consumption and recommend optimal delivery schedules, or do we manage scheduling?"**
  - Managed accounts move proactively. Transactional accounts put the burden on you.

- **"What's included in your pricing, and what triggers additional charges?"**
  - You should understand emergency surcharges, after-hours fees, and volume adjustments clearly.

- **"What documentation will you provide, and what do we need to keep on our end for compliance?"**
  - This shows they understand their role in your audit trail.

---

## Section 8: Making Your Decision

### Keep your current vendor if:

- On-time delivery is consistently 95%+
- Emergency calls are answered and fuel arrives within promised timeframes
- Supply is predictable and managed proactively
- Compliance documentation is complete and accurate
- Communication is responsive and proactive
- Service fits your operational needs
- Pricing is fair and transparent

### Have a serious conversation with your vendor if:

- Any reliability metric is below 90%
- Emergencies go unanswered or take longer than acceptable
- You're still managing supply manually instead of on a scheduled plan
- Documentation is inconsistent
- Communication is slow or reactive
- There are geographic or service-type gaps
- Pricing is opaque or significantly above market

### Explore alternatives if:

- Reliability is chronically below 90%
- Emergency response is unreliable
- You regularly run unplanned stockouts
- Your vendor cannot meet minimum compliance standards
- Your operational needs have changed and current vendor can't adapt
- A better-fit vendor is available in your area

## Planning for the Year Ahead

Once you've completed your review, write down three things:

### 1. What to protect:
What's working in your current fuel program? Don't change it. Make sure your vendor knows it matters.

**Example:** "Our on-time delivery has been consistent. We need that to continue."

### 2. What to improve:
Where is there friction? What would make your operation smoother? Be specific.

**Example:** "We're still scheduling every delivery manually. We need automatic/monitored delivery so we don't have to think about it."

### 3. What conversations to have:
With your vendor, your team, or with alternative vendors—what needs to be addressed?

**Example:** "I need to understand our response time commitment for generators during peak cooling season. Our current vendor hasn't given us specific SLAs."

## Key Metrics to Track Going Forward

Once you've completed your annual review, track these metrics monthly:

| Metric | Target | How to Track |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| On-time delivery rate | 95%+ | Count deliveries on schedule / total deliveries |
| Unplanned stockouts | 0 | Count emergency fuel orders triggered by running out |
| Average emergency response time | < 4 hours | Document actual time from call to fuel arrival |
| Documentation completeness | 100% | Verify you have tickets for every delivery |
| Scheduled vs. reactive orders | 90%+ scheduled | Count planned deliveries / total deliveries |

Keep these in a simple spreadsheet. At the end of the year, you'll have concrete data for next year's review.

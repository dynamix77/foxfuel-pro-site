<h2>Section 1: Reliability Assessment</h2>

<h3>Did your fuel arrive when promised?</h3>

<p>Operational continuity depends on delivery predictability. This is not about the lowest price—it's about whether you could plan your operations around your fuel supply.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On-time delivery rate:</strong> In the past 12 months, what percentage of scheduled deliveries arrived within the agreed window? Track this as a metric. If it's below 95%, you have a reliability problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Emergency response time:</strong> Did your fuel vendor answer emergency calls? How quickly did fuel arrive? Document actual response times from your last 3-5 emergencies (if applicable).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Missed or delayed deliveries:</strong> How many deliveries missed the scheduled window by more than 2 hours? Did this cause operational impact (equipment downtime, project delays, generator cycling off)?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Communication during disruptions:</strong> When there was a delivery issue, did your vendor proactively contact you or did you discover the problem yourself?</p>

<p><strong>What to do with these answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If on-time performance is consistently above 95% and emergencies are handled reliably: your vendor is meeting baseline operational standards.</li>
  <li>If on-time performance drops below 90% or emergencies go unanswered: this is a risk. Address it now, not when a failure costs you downtime.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 2: Supply Certainty</h2>

<h3>Could you confidently count on fuel being available?</h3>

<p>Supply certainty means you never ran out unplanned, and you never had to scramble to find backup fuel. It means your vendor planned with you, not for you.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unplanned stockouts:</strong> How many times did you run out of fuel before the next scheduled delivery? (This should be zero for managed accounts.)</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Scheduled vs. unscheduled deliveries:</strong> How much of your fuel came from scheduled deliveries vs. emergency "we ran out" orders? Ideally, 90%+ should be scheduled.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Communication about your consumption:</strong> Did your vendor track your usage patterns and suggest delivery timing, or did you have to initiate every order?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Seasonal adjustments:</strong> Did your vendor account for winter demand spikes or summer downticks, or did you have to manually adjust delivery schedules?</p>

<p><strong>What to do with these answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If most deliveries are scheduled and consumption-based: your vendor understands your operation and is managing proactively.</li>
  <li>If you're constantly ordering reactively or running emergencies: you need a vendor who monitors your usage and schedules ahead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3: Compliance and Documentation</h2>

<h3>Is your fuel program audit-ready?</h3>

<p>For facilities with regulatory requirements (healthcare, government, critical infrastructure), compliance is operational. Missing documentation is risk.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Delivery documentation:</strong> Do you have delivery tickets for every fuel delivery? Are quantities accurate and signatures present?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Fuel quality records:</strong> For generators or critical equipment, do you have records showing fuel was tested or polished as required?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tax documentation:</strong> For tax-exempt organizations, did your vendor provide the required paperwork? Are off-road and on-road fuels properly documented for tax purposes?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Hazmat compliance:</strong> If you received bulk or hazmat-classified fuel, did your vendor handle manifests and transport compliance correctly?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Audit trail:</strong> Could you reconstruct your fuel spending and consumption for the past 12 months if an auditor asked?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do with these answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have complete documentation for every delivery: your vendor is compliance-aware and professional.</li>
  <li>If documentation is inconsistent or missing: request a complete audit report from your vendor. If they can't provide it, this is a governance risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 4: Cost Management</h2>

        <figure class="article-content-image">
          <img src="images/annual-fuel-review-checklist-inline.png" alt="Fuel program evaluation metrics dashboard showing reliability, compliance, and cost tracking" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">
        </figure>

<h3>Are you paying a fair price for reliable service?</h3>

<p>Price matters, but it ranks after reliability, compliance, and certainty. If you're paying the lowest price but getting unreliable service, you're not actually saving money—you're shifting risk.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Annual spending:</strong> What did you spend on fuel in the past 12 months? Break this into: scheduled deliveries, emergency/rush deliveries, and any premium charges.</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Price transparency:</strong> Did your vendor explain their pricing model clearly? Do you understand what you're paying for (fuel, delivery, emergency surcharges)?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Contract terms:</strong> Are you on a fixed price, a variable price tied to wholesale rates, or a cost-plus model? Do you understand how the formula works?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Volume discounts:</strong> If your volume increased or decreased, did your pricing adjust accordingly?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Competitor pricing:</strong> Have you checked what competitors charge for comparable service in your area? Understand the market range, but remember: the cheapest quote often reflects the lowest service standard.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do with these answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If pricing is transparent, aligned with market rates, and tied to actual service reliability: you're paying fairly.</li>
  <li>If pricing is vague, higher than regional averages for no clear reason, or incentivizes volume over reliability: it's time to discuss terms or explore alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 5: Vendor Responsiveness and Communication</h2>

<h3>Does your vendor feel like a partner or a transaction?</h3>

<p>Operational continuity requires vendors who understand your business and communicate proactively. Not all fuel vendors operate this way.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Account contact:</strong> Do you have a dedicated account contact or do you reach a call center? Can you reach the same person multiple times?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Responsiveness:</strong> When you call or email, how long does it take to get an answer? Is 24 hours typical, or do you usually hear back within hours?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proactive communication:</strong> Does your vendor suggest improvements, alert you to market changes, or recommend service adjustments—or do you always have to initiate conversation?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Problem resolution:</strong> When something went wrong (late delivery, billing issue, equipment problem), how was it handled? Did your vendor take ownership or push back?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>24/7 availability:</strong> For emergencies, can you reach someone who can dispatch fuel outside business hours?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do with these answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a dedicated contact, quick responses, and proactive suggestions: your vendor understands commercial operations.</li>
  <li>If communication is slow, generic, or reactive: you're being served as a transaction, not as an account. This matters when you need something urgently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 6: Operational Fit</h2>

<h3>Does your fuel vendor understand your specific operation?</h3>

<p>Not all fuel vendors can serve all customers well. The question is not "Are they good?" but "Are they good for us?"</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Service type fit:</strong> If you need fleet fueling, does your vendor deliver to yards or force you to use gas stations? If you need generator fuel, do they understand standby equipment requirements?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Scale fit:</strong> If you're a 5-truck fleet, can a vendor designed for 50-truck fleets serve you well? If you're industrial-scale, can a small local vendor handle your volume?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Geographic fit:</strong> Does your vendor cover your entire operational area, or do you have coverage gaps? Are there locations where their response time is slow?</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Equipment compatibility:</strong> Does your fuel type (on-road diesel, off-road diesel, heating oil, DEF) match what your vendor supplies? Are there products you need that they don't offer?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Minimum requirements:</strong> Does your vendor have minimums (volume, delivery frequency, account value) that don't fit your business? Are you paying for service you don't use?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do with these answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If your operation and your vendor's capabilities align: stay focused on relationship and continuous improvement.</li>
  <li>If there are mismatches (size, geography, service type): you're fighting friction that could be solved by finding a better-fit vendor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 7: Benchmark Questions for Your Vendor</h2>

<p>After completing Sections 1-6, have a conversation with your fuel vendor about the year ahead. Here are the questions that matter:</p>

<h3>During the conversation:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"What do you see as our top operational risk with fuel supply, and how would you address it?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>- A vendor that understands your operation will have a specific answer, not generic service promises.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"If we need emergency fuel at 2 AM on a weekend, will you answer the phone and can you deliver the same day?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>- Listen for specific response time commitments, not "we'll do our best."</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"Can you track our consumption and recommend optimal delivery schedules, or do we manage scheduling?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>- Managed accounts move proactively. Transactional accounts put the burden on you.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"What's included in your pricing, and what triggers additional charges?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>- You should understand emergency surcharges, after-hours fees, and volume adjustments clearly.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"What documentation will you provide, and what do we need to keep on our end for compliance?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>- This shows they understand their role in your audit trail.</p>

<h2>Section 8: Making Your Decision</h2>

<h3>Keep your current vendor if:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>On-time delivery is consistently 95%+</li>
  <li>Emergency calls are answered and fuel arrives within promised timeframes</li>
  <li>Supply is predictable and managed proactively</li>
  <li>Compliance documentation is complete and accurate</li>
  <li>Communication is responsive and proactive</li>
  <li>Service fits your operational needs</li>
  <li>Pricing is fair and transparent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Have a serious conversation with your vendor if:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Any reliability metric is below 90%</li>
  <li>Emergencies go unanswered or take longer than acceptable</li>
  <li>You're still managing supply manually instead of on a scheduled plan</li>
  <li>Documentation is inconsistent</li>
  <li>Communication is slow or reactive</li>
  <li>There are geographic or service-type gaps</li>
  <li>Pricing is opaque or significantly above market</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explore alternatives if:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Reliability is chronically below 90%</li>
  <li>Emergency response is unreliable</li>
  <li>You regularly run unplanned stockouts</li>
  <li>Your vendor cannot meet minimum compliance standards</li>
  <li>Your operational needs have changed and current vendor can't adapt</li>
  <li>A better-fit vendor is available in your area</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planning for the Year Ahead</h2>

<p>Once you've completed your review, write down three things:</p>

<h3>1. What to protect:</h3>
<p>What's working in your current fuel program? Don't change it. Make sure your vendor knows it matters.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> "Our on-time delivery has been consistent. We need that to continue."</p>

<h3>2. What to improve:</h3>
<p>Where is there friction? What would make your operation smoother? Be specific.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> "We're still scheduling every delivery manually. We need automatic/monitored delivery so we don't have to think about it."</p>

<h3>3. What conversations to have:</h3>
<p>With your vendor, your team, or with alternative vendors—what needs to be addressed?</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I need to understand our response time commitment for generators during peak cooling season. Our current vendor hasn't given us specific SLAs."</p>

<h2>Key Metrics to Track Going Forward</h2>

<p>Once you've completed your annual review, track these metrics monthly:</p>

<table class="comparison-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Target</th>
      <th>How to Track</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>On-time delivery rate</td>
      <td>95%+</td>
      <td>Count deliveries on schedule / total deliveries</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unplanned stockouts</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Count emergency fuel orders triggered by running out</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Average emergency response time</td>
      <td>< 4 hours</td>
      <td>Document actual time from call to fuel arrival</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Documentation completeness</td>
      <td>100%</td>
      <td>Verify you have tickets for every delivery</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Scheduled vs. reactive orders</td>
      <td>90%+ scheduled</td>
      <td>Count planned deliveries / total deliveries</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Keep these in a simple spreadsheet. At the end of the year, you'll have concrete data for next year's review.</p>
